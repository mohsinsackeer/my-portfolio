        "I am a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, having earned a B.Tech degree. During my academic journey, I played the role as a core member of the Technical Society of IIT Madras, where I led the 'Inter Hostel Competitions' vertical. In this capacity, I managed a team, organizing engaging tech inter-hostel events that fostered healthy competition and collaboration among students.",
        "Beyond academia, I worked on projects to sharpen my technical skills by successfully building a Web-Based Messaging platform from scratch and contributing to an Android application for a nonprofit organization. Additionally, I was involved with an NGO 'Tensors,' where I contributed to organizing mock JEE exams to raise funds, which was used for social causes.",
        "In my leisure time, I enjoy football, reading, occasional binge-watching, and embarking on journeys of self-discovery driven by curiosity."
